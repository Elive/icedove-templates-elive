            This is an example of a template, with them, you can write your emails in a lot more <b>professional</b> look.<br><br>
            If you want to design your own template it is very easy, you need to write it in <b>html format</b>, you have a lot of ways to write an html, for example, you can simply design your template on this Email application like if you are editing a simple email, when you have it click in the tab where it says <i>Source Code (HTML)</i>, then you just need to copy this html code to a external file and you have your template ready. Note: If you are using external elements like images, it is <b>strongly</b> recommended to put all these files in a own directory where you have everything, after you have all the elements that you want to use you can create your design, so that they will point to that directory, when you have finished, save the html content to a html file and put it to this directory too.
            <br> 
            <br> 
            One time you have your template ready, is time to add it to your Email application, in the icon where you click for write a new email you have a small arrow where it shows all your templates that you can use, there's a special option to add a new one, click there, and select your .html file
            <br> 
            <br> 
            Ready, you can use it
            <br> 
            <br> 
            <br> 
            Enjoy! :)
